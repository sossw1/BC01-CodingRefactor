# BC01-CodingRefactor

## Description

The starter html file for this site originally had no semantic elements and was difficult to follow visually. The CSS selectors were numerous and many were using multiple id's to apply the same properties to similar content. The CSS file was disorganized as well, mainly adhering to the order of the html file. The site would be fairly difficult to navigate with accessibility tools such as screen readers.

I have updated the HTML and CSS files to be more organized. Ultimately, many of the changes made improve the accessibility of the page, resulting in better user experience and search engine optimization results. The site's revised semantic structure affords the user a clearer picture of the layout. The new site title and alternative text for images affords the opportunity to engage with content.

The CSS selectors are sorted by category (all, tag, class and id). Within those categories, they are sorted to follow the semantic structure. Many selectors have been consolidated, no two tags have the same effects. This makes site maintenance and updates easier.
